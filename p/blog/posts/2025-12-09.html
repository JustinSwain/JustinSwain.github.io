          While researching Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) I learned about the <a href="https://proofofhumanity.id/">proof of humanity</a>. A ZKP that proves you are a real flesh-and-blood human and not an AI replicant by assigning a unique personal identifier that is verified through a zero-knowledge ceremony on the public blockchain.

          I imagined a future where instead of door-to-door salesmen, we get armed Ethereum guards knocking on our doors so our unique human characteristics can be scanned by the privately-funded government oracle for upload and hash into the local Merkle tree.

          This kind of dystopian absurdity is the kind of thing you'd see in a Neal Stephenson novel - so I asked Chat-GPT to write a short story. The result is too good not to share.

        <h3>The Day the Drive-Thru Went Offline</h3>
        <em style="font-size: 0.8rem">In the style of Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash</em>
        <p>
          At first, Proof of Humanity was supposed to dignify the species. But once it reached critical mass, the real test of civilization came when the McDonald's app refused service.

          Some guy -- mid-commute, mid-existential crisis -- tries to redeem his McRib points and gets hit with a red pop-up:
        </p>

        <em style="color: #ff8391">
          ERROR: Unverified consciousness. Please register your iris on the World ID blockchain.
        </em>

          He blinks at it like it's a joke. It isn't. The drive-thru scanner blinks back -- a small, chrome hemisphere mounted beside the card reader, humming with moral authority. The teenager at the window shrugs; her training module didn't cover ontological verification.
        </p>

        <p>
          "You can't prove you're a person, sir," she says, in the bored tone of someone quoting company policy.

          He looks around at the other cars -- a line of commuters, all holding up their phones like penitents before a digital relic. The Orbs whirr, confirm, and the golden arches bestow their blessings: "Transaction verified: Human. Fries added to cart."
        </p>

        <p>
          That's how the singularity actually arrived -- not with AI overthrowing mankind, but with mankind begging an algorithm to recognize its soul before breakfast.
