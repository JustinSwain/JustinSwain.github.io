        Beans is orange, long, skinny, wirey, hungry, but most of all he is kitty.

        Beans was adopted in June 2023 from the Denton Animal Shelter. Maybe because he was so long they thought he was older than one year, but he was definitely still a kitty.

        Beans has zero ability to focus and he doesn't learn rules after he gets in trouble. He knows he is on the bottom of the cat totem pole because he will bow his head to his brothers and wait for kisses.

        Beans has triangle shaped pupils. We think he may have <a href="https://pictures-of-cats.org/domestic-cat-with-triangular-shaped-pupils-coloboma.html">coloboma</a>. Apparently, it doesn't hurt Beans, but it makes it hard for him to see in bright sunlight.

        Beans is permanently hungry, and never gets fat no matter how much he eats. He constantly tries to find food in the trash, or in the sink.

        For some reason Beans likes to sit in front of our cat camera and stare into it. It makes it look like he is in a Zoom meeting.
