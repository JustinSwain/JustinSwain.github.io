            <h3>Welcome!</h3>
            <p>
                You should have a website! Why? Because the internet was a lot cooler when everyone's homepage was customized to exactly how they liked it. People made personal websites to display their work, honor their favorite TV show, communicate with friends, and more!
            </p>
            <p>
                The only "hard" part is learning how to make one. But really it is no "harder" than working with MicroSoft Word. Once somebody shows you how to start you will be customizing your HTML and CSS files with ease!
            </p>
            <strong>Why should you use this guide?</strong>
            <p>
                There are probably millions of HTML and CSS tutorials in print or online. Almost all of them will be better to teach you how to create your own website. However, my goal is not to teach your how to create your own, but rather how to steal this website!

            <h3>Get Started</h3>
            <p>
                Here is a step-by-step guide for getting your website started. This guide only assumes you have a computer with internet, and know how to write/read english. I will show you how to prepare your computer for coding, then I will give you a code to copy-and-paste to get your homepage running. After that we will go line by line through the code to learn HTML and CSS. Finally, I will show you how to add your own code so you can start customizing your site to the way you imagine it!
            </p>
            <p>By the end of this guide you should have:
                <ul>
                    <li>A working homepage</li>
                    <li>A nice style sheet</li>
                    <li>The ability to read your own code</li>
                    <li>An idea about how to learn more!</li>
