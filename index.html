                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a PhD student studying mathematics at the University of North Texas (UNT) in Denton, TX. I also obtained a B.S. in mathematics at UNT.
                    <br>
                    My wife, Cassidy, and I live in Providence Village, TX with our five cats Jinx, Beans, Zed, Ninja, and Pluto. (ordered from least to most rotten)

                    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
                    <p>
                        My main research interest is numerical methods for nematic liquid crystals, and other phase field models.
                        Specifically, I have been working on building numerical methods for simulating nematic liquid crystals using a Q-tensor model.
                        In addition, I have also worked on numerical methods for the Cahn-Hilliard phase field model.
