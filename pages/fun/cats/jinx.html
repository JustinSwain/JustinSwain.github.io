            Jinx is a happy, friendly, all around good-natured black cat! He brings good luck!
        </p>

            If his room looks dark and spooky don't worry! Jinx likes it that way!
        </p>
        <p>
            Jinx was adopted from the Dallas Humane Society on March 26, 2021. He was born in a s*tanic house of cat hoarders that would frequently drop off large groups of black cats at the shelter. Sad!
        </p>
        <p>
           For this reason, Jinx tends to like dark and spooky things like tunnels, and dragons. But don't be fooled, he is very friendly!
        </p>

        <p>
            In fact, Jinx may have some dragon blood in him afterall. He loves to sun himself in the window all day until his black fur turns brown.
        </p>

            You will never catch Jinx in a bad mood. He is always willing to play, or cuddle, or nap. Whatever you want to do, Jinx is happy to join.
        </p>

            He is generally goofy and has long legs that go wild in every direction when he plays. He usually gets short bursts of energy that he spends by sprinting around the house.

        <p>
            In Summer 2023, Jinx developed a small mass on his back left leg. It turned out to be Feline Injection Site Sarcoma (FISS), a rare cancer caused by injections (typically the rabies vaccine).
        </p>
        <p>
            Within the week he had his mass removed and tested. Fortunately, the cancer was removed but only very narrowly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, at the advice of a vet oncologist, Jinx had his back left leg amputated in August 2023.
        </p>

            If you think Jinx slowed down after losing one of his legs, then think again!
        </p>
        <p>
            The recovery process was a bit rough, but he got through it and is a happy tripod cat. He can run, and play, and jump, and do all the things he did before. (except scratch his left ear)
