        Pluto is a tiny tabby cat. He is a terrible, awful, no good, very bad brother but a huge Dada's boy.

        From an early age, Ninja taught him the way of the tabby. However, not even Ninja realized how much of a monster he created. Pluto thinks tabbies are awesome and orange cats are stupid.

        Pluto likes to push his brothers heads into the ground, steal their food, bite their tails, and tear off their collars. All while appearing to be a sweet baby when his Dada is around.

        It could be that he has a case of "Little Man Syndorme." Pluto is the tiniest out of the five, even smaller than Beans who is a kitty. He thinks <a href="/pages/fun/cats/jinx.html">Jinx</a> is his baby brother since he was adopted first but Jinx is actually older and bigger.

        Pluto's favorite toys are mousies. Its probably because he sort of looks like a tiny mouse. He was so proud of himself when he grew big enough to be able to pick up his toys in his mouth.

        When he is not playing with mousies or bullying his brothers he is probably judging people. He likes to sit in the window and glare at people as they walk by.

        Despite being so mean, he is still a tiny baby though so his brothers don't take him too seriously.
