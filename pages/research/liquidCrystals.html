                You see liquid crystals all the time, they are in your TV, computer, phone, iPad, and more!

                Liquid crystals are like tiny sticks that can be moved with electricity. When you turn on your TV it uses a big light to shine through liquid crystals and electricity to move the tiny sticks around to make pictures!
            </p>
            <p>
                Mathematicians like me try to make computer programs that help us learn more about liquid crystals. Then we use our programs to help engineers build things with liquid crystals. Some cool things that people are building are tiny liquid crystal robots, fake muscles made out of liquid crystals, liquid crystal lasers and more!

                What are liquid crystals? 
            </p>
            <p>
                You are probably looking at some right now! Liquid crystals are used to make liquid crystal displays or LCD screens. These are used in phones, tablets, computers, TVs, watches, and more!

                But how do they work?
            </p>
            <p>
                Tiny objects called molecules are all around us. Molecules are the building blocks of all matter: solids, liquids, and gasses. Different objects have different molecules, with all sorts of shapes and sizes. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Most things are in one of the three main states of matter: solid, liquid, and ice. Think of solid ice water that is heated up until it metls into liquid water. Liquid crystals are special because their molecules are long like a stick, or a baseball bat which causes them to form a state of matter between liquid and solid called the nematic liquid crystal phase.
            </p>

            <p>
                Think about putting a bunch of baseball bats in a box. You can stack the baseball bats on top of each other but they might not all be exactly straight. If you shake the box then the bats might slide past each other and move around in the box but as soon as you stop shaking they will line up again and stay still.
            </p>
            <p>
                That is how the molecules in a liquid crystal act! They are like slippery sticks that can move past each other but they all point in the same direction. There are different ways we can make the liquid crystal molecules move: by heating them up, using electricity, adding chemicals, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                So how do LCD screens work?
            </p>
            <p>
                The liquid crystals are in the screen just behind the glass. Behind the liquid crystals is a light that shines through the screen towards your eyeballs. By using electricity, the LCD screen will make the liquid crystals move to block some of the light which is how the image appears on the screen.
            </p>

            <p>
                Why do mathematicans study liquid crystals?
            </p>
            <p>
                Because liquid crystals are super small and very expensive! Working with the crystals can be hard because they are way too small to see in a microscope.
            </p>
            <p>
                So mathematicians like me make computer programs that can do liquid crystal experiments virtually. But making these programs is not easy! It takes lots of math, physics, and computer programming to do these virtual experiments. Most people working on making these programs are professors at universities that have been studying math for many years!
            </p>
            <p>
                There are more uses for liquid crystals thatn just screens. Mathematicians have worked with engineers to make some new technologies for liquid crystals like liquid crystal nano-robots, sensors that can go in your body to help doctors diagnose diseases, artificial muscles, liquid crystal lasers, and more!
